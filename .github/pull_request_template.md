<!-- 
BEFORE OPENING A PULL REQUEST:
-> If you're adding multiple independent changes (e.g. adding a section about modding while also fixing a typo on another page) it's generally recommended to split these changes into separate pull requests.

Note that pull requests containing lots of unhelpful commit messages will generally be squashed to keep commit history clean.
