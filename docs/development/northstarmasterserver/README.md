{% hint style="warning" %}
The old NodeJS master server has been replaced in favour of the Go rewrite called Atlas.

## Introduction

The master server is responsible for centralizing game servers created by players, it also verifies that connecting players own an Origin account with Titanfall 2.

There's no need to host your own master server to play games with other people, you can use [direct connect](../../using-northstar/direct-connect.md) or just setup a [normal server](../../hosting-a-server-with-northstar/basic-listen-server.md) that announces itself to `northstar.tf`. This tutorial is aimed for those who want to contribute improvements to the code or test their own changes to the project.
