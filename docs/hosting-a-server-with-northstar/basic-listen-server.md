# Hosting a Basic Listen Server

## Requirements

Make sure to check that your server is reachable as [described here](./getting-started.md)

Make sure you already installed Northstar [as described here](../installing-northstar/basic-setup.md).

## Instructions

To host a listen server on Northstar, go to the lobby and press the `Private Match` button to begin a private match. While this does allow you to host a server, other people won't be able to join it, so you'll need to port forward UDP port `37015` to allow other people to join.\
If this works correctly, this should result in your server being displayed on the server browser, and other clients being able to connect to it.\

## Server Configuration

Whether you're running a listen or dedicated server, you'll generally want to mess with the configuration at least a bit. While I do think the default configuration settings are pretty ok, being able to change your server's name or password, or increasing your server's tickrate is often something you'll want to do. Server configuration can be modified in the file `R2Northstar/mods/Northstar.CustomServers/mod/cfg/autoexec_ns_server.cfg`, which will be executed on server startup.\

Additionally dedicated server settings and configs can be used on a listen server.\
Server startup arguments can be placed into `Titanfall2/ns_startup_args.txt`\
Convars can be placed into `R2Northstar/mods/Northstar.CustomServers/mod/cfg/autoexec_ns_server.cfg`
The only difference between a listen and dedicated server is that a listen can only run while the host is in the match. 

Below are a series of variables and commands you can use for server configuration:

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default Value                  |

## Tips and tricks:

To change gamemode and map, run:

```
sv_cheats 1; script GameRules_ChangeMap( "mp_forwardbase_kodai", "ctf" ); sv_cheats 0
```

replace `mp_forwardbase_kodai` and `ctf` with your desired map and gamemode.\
The list of maps can be found [here](server-settings/file-names.md#maps).\
The list of gamemodes [here](server-settings/file-names.md#vanilla).

If someone keeps messing with the settings, set `ns_private_match_only_host_can_change_settings` to `2`, so that only you can change them.

Set `ns_private_match_countdown_length` to `1` if you don't want to wait for the countdown timer when you start a match. \
Additionally, set `ns_private_match_only_host_can_start` to `1` so that only you can actually press the _start match_ button.
