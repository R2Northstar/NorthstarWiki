# Hosting a Dedicated Server

## Hosting a Dedicated Server

### Setup

Dedicated servers allow you to host a Northstar server without having to use a full client, making them more lightweight and easier to host for longer periods of time. Dedicated servers are still in development for Northstar, so while they do work, expect some bugs and general jank.\
To start a dedicated server on Northstar, launch NorthstarLauncher.exe with the argument `-dedicated`, this can be done manually, but releases also provide the batch file `r2ds.bat`, which will also do this.\
When using a dedicated server, arguments are read from `ns_startup_args_dedi.txt`, rather than `ns_startup_args.txt`.

#### Useful configuration files

* `ns_startup_args_dedi.txt`\
  contains the [startup arguments](./#startup-arguments)
* `R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.CustomServers\mod.json`\
  contains [ConVars](./#convars) default values
* `R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.CustomServers\mod\cfg\autoexec_ns_server.cfg`\
  contains [ConVars](./#convars) and overrides

### Dedicated Server Caveats

At the moment, dedicated servers still require DirectX 11 to work, which typically requires a physical GPU, though they use almost no GPU processing power while in use, this can be an issue especially on GPU-less setups, so the launch argument `-softwared3d11` can be used to force DirectX to run in software mode.\
While this is absolutely not ideal, it's the best solution for truely headless dedicated servers at the moment, and surprisingly hardly uses any CPU time, though it can use roughly up to 1GB of RAM.\
Regarding RAM usage, dedicated servers also use significant amounts of RAM at the moment, often requiring 1.5-2GB, though I expect this to lower as development continues.

### Troubleshoot

See [troubleshoot](troubleshoot.md)

## Startup Arguments

Startup arguments can be added in the `ns_startup_args_dedi.txt` file.\
Example: `+setplaylist private_match +mp_gamemode ps`

| Arguments                  | Accepted Values                                                 | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+setplaylist`             | see [Gamemodes](./#gamemodes) (Should be the same as `mp_gamemode` unless you want a private match) | Set the server type (If it is not `private_match`, make sure you have also included `+map` and NOT `mp_lobby` or else you can't search your server in the game) |
| `+setplaylistvaroverrides` | see [PlaylistOverrides](./#playlist-overrides)                  | Edits the behaviour of the server                                         |
| `-port`                    | int beteween `1-65535`                                          | Determines which UDP port the server will listen to                       |
| `+mp_gamemode`             | see [Gamemodes](./#gamemodes)                                   | Forces the gamemode of the server                                         |
| `+map`                     | see [Maps](./#maps) (`mp_lobby` is the default if not included) | Forces the map of the server at the first start                           |

| Flags                 | Description                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-maxplayersplaylist` | Allows [PlaylistOverrides](./#playlist-overrides) to override max player count |
| `-enablechathooks`    | Allows send the commands using in-game chat                                    |

### Playlist overrides

Playlist overrides determines the behaviour of the server. PlaylistOverrides can be added using the `+setplaylistvaroverrides` argument in the `ns_startup_args_dedi.txt` file.

The list of playlist overrides needs to be quoted and separated by spaces.\
Example: `+setplaylistvaroverrides "run_epilogue 0 featured_mode_amped_tacticals 1"`

| PlaylistOverrides                            | Accepted Values | Default Value | Description                                                                                    |

| `custom_air_accel_pilot`                     |                 |               |                                                                                                |

| `run_epilogue`                               | `0-1`           | `1`           | Enables escape dropship                                                                        |

| `boosts_enabled`                             | `0-1`           | `0`           | Disable boosts. Doesn't disable Titanmeter. Note that unlike the name suggests `1` disables boosts |

## Convars

Convars are located inside the `R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.CustomServers\mod\cfg\autoexec_ns_server.cfg` file.

They allow the server admin to set server's properties like the name, TCP port, and description.

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default Value                  | Accepted Values                                    |
