# Hosting a Dedicated Server

If you want to host a server long term you cant always run a game instance on your PC. 

For this we have two ways to host 
* [Docker image](./hosting-on-linux.md) for Linux (generally recomended for long term hosting)
* [Windows hosting](./hosting-on-windows.md) (good for short term hosting)

### Troubleshooting

If you are having issues running your server its best to check out the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) page before asking for help.
