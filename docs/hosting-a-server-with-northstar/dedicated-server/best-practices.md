## Optimization Commands (Optional)

| Command                          | Description                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `net_compresspackets 1`          | Enable compress packets                                                                                                        |
| `net_compresspackets_minsize 64` | Decrease usage from ~12-16 mbps to ~6-8 mbps on 20 player PVP server and ~9-12mbps to ~5-7 mbps on 12 player gun game server   |
| `sv_maxrate 127000`              | Sets the maximum bandwidth rate allowed (both incoming/outcoming) per second (in bytes)                                        |
