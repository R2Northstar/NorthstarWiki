# Hosting on Windows

{% hint style="warning" %}
The GitBook based NorthstarWiki has been replaced in favour of the [NorthstarDocs](https://docs.northstar.tf/) where this wiki has been integrated.

## Minimum requirements

The current minimum requirements are as follows:

**Requirements per server:**

- 8GB free disk space (5GB of the game and 3 for Origin/EA app)
- 3+ cores (2 might work, though)
- 3GB+ total memory (RAM or swap will do)
- Windows 8.1 (and built-in WARP \[use `-softwared3d11`\] or a graphics card)

**Per instance:**

- 2GB RAM (this is what's actually used; it does drop to ~1.2GB after a bit)
- 15 Mbps network upload, but 10 is workable, 25 if you want to avoid players getting disconnected when going back to the lobby after a match

**Note:** It is recommended to surpass the listed requirements. Currently the number of available servers covers the daily playerbase more than enough. If you're planning to host public servers for the community it is therefore recommended to either fill a niche (like a gamemode that is so popular that all existing servers are full) or provide a better service than existing hosts (less lag, more stable, etc.).
