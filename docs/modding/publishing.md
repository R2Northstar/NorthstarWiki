# Publishing your mod

## Best practices

Make sure to name your mod in the form `<your name>.<mod name>`, similar to the existing default mods, like `Northstar.Client`, `Northstar.CusomServer`, ... \
Note that the Northstar name (`Northstar.xyz`) is reserved for mods delievered with the Northstar install and should therefore **NOT** be used.

It is recommended to upload the source code of your mod to a public repository like [Github](https://github.com/) to give your users a place to suggest changes and leave feedback in an organised manner.

## Thunderstore

The best place to publish your mod is [Thunderstore](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/). To do so, you need to package your mod as a zip with a specific folder structure. You can either set the structure up manually or use [this GitHub template](https://github.com/laundmo/northstar-mod-template)

## Thunderstore package structure

The Thunderstore package zip structure is as follows:

```
mods/<your name>.<mod name>/
icon.png
manifest.json
README.md
```

- `icon.png`: 256x256px icon for your mod.
- `README.md`: the description page for your mod
- `manifest.json` outlined [here](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/)

You can put multiple mods in the `mods/` folder, but only do this if neccessary.

## Uploading

After you have set up the folder structure, head to https://northstar.thunderstore.io and log in with either Discord or Github. Then you can use the Upload button at the top to upload your zip.

When uploading, it will verify your package structure and you can publish after its successfully checked.

To update a mod, change the version in mod.json and manifest.json, and upload again. If the mod name is the same, it will update the previous version.
