# Troubleshooting

Generally try to first launch the vanilla game (i.e. not Northstar) if you encounter any issue and see if it also occurs there as well. Some problems can occur when the vanilla game was never launched before using Northstar.

A lot of problems around the game failing to communicate with Origin can also be prevented by launching Origin before Northstar should you encounter any issues in that regard.

Also note that some solutions described below can also apply to the base game, like issues caused by [10th+ gen Intel CPUs](troubleshooting.md#intel).

## LSX Authentication Failed <a href="#lsx" id="lsx"></a>

![LSX Authentication Challenge failed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97235072/148391447-300e1b47-6148-43f7-8854-b0882e150d12.png)

If the usual workaround of restarting Origin/rebooting or running the vanilla game first and then Northstar donâ€™t work, try the following:

* First and foremost, double check that you are _logged in_ on Origin. Titanfall will _not_ run if you are not connected to EA servers first (and neither will Titanfall + Northstar).
* [Add the northstar commandline option in your launcher](troubleshooting.md#launch-opts)
* Run the game with Origin/Steam instead of starting NorthstarLauncher.exe (important)
* Sign out and exit Origin, then start Northstar. It will prompt you for a login, _hopefully_ fixing it if nothing else worked
* Start normal Titanfall 2 and then Northstar (_ONLY WORKS SOMETIMES_)

## Tier0.dll Not found <a href="#tier0" id="tier0"></a>

![Failed to load the tier0.dll](../images/northstar-launcher-error-wrong-location.png)

This error is usually caused by running the `NorthstarLauncher.exe` in the wrong location, such as extracting the zip it came with directly in your Downloads folder and running it there.

* Default Steam Location: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Titanfall2\`
* Default Origin Location: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Origin Games\Titanfall2\`

**If it still appears after trying the fix above:** It's possible that you may have **corrupted or missing** game files

* First check `\bin\x64\_retail\` and check if you have these files

![bin folder](../images/bin-folder.png)

* If you dont have them verify your game on steam/origin/ea

## File Corruption Detected <a href="#file-corruption" id="file-corruption"></a>

![Engine Error: File corruption detected. Please repair or re-install the game.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39478251/147338706-74797220-7d7f-4c81-9ba0-d88e29a2a1e2.png)

Don't panic! This warning isn't as serious as it seems. It's simply an incorrect error message caused by Origin/EA App. If you get this warning after launching the game, try updating your Northstar install to the [newest release](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases), as this error was mostly resolved in version `v1.4.0`.

If that doesn't work, you should verify your Titanfall2 files. If you're confused on how to verify files, follow [this](troubleshooting.md#verify-files) guide.

## Failed copying wsock32.dll <a href="#wsock" id="wsock"></a>

You are probably using EA Desktop app and it sets up game installations with no write permissions contrary to Origin.

### Solution 1

* Launch EA Desktop and the game as admin once so that it can copy that file.

### Solution 2

1. Copy `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wsock32.dll` to your Desktop / Temporary folder.
2. Rename the copied file to `wsock32.org.dll`.
3. Move `wsock32.org.dll` into `Titanfall2/bin/x64_retail/`.
4. Delete the copied `wsock32.org.dll` from your Desktop / Temporary folder.

Do NOT make any changes in `system32`, just copy the file.

### Solution 3

1. Locate your `Titanfall2` folder
2. Right click it and go `Properties > Security`
3. Give yourself write permissions

## Can't Join Servers (Issues with 10th+ gen Intel CPUs) <a href="#intel" id="intel"></a>

![Newer Intel CPU error: Data Center: Searching...](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18601697/148625000-882bf1db-b9b2-4e9e-88db-6d608e58a35b.png)

On newer Intel CPUs you might see a message like this

> "Contacting Respawn servers.../Data Center: Searching..."

If you are seeing this in the main menu of TF|2 and have a 10th or 11th generation Intel CPU this is a bug which has a simple fix:

In the Windows Start menu on the bottom left search for "Edit the system environment variables" and open the program. In the "advanced" tab click on "Environment Variables..." near the bottom.\
In System Variables (not user variables) click "New..." and add a new system variable where the variable name is `OPENSSL_ia32cap` and the value is `~0x200000200000000`. Make sure to click OK to apply the changes. Finally restart your device and you should be good to go.

If you're on Linux, you can set the appropriate environment variable via `env OPENSSL_ia32cap=~0x20000000 %command%`.

**Note:** This issue is not exclusive to Northstar client but also affects the vanilla version, so if you only get it on Northstar there might be a different problem at hand as well. In fact it's not even unique to Titanfall 2 either.

## I disabled all mods and now I cannot re-enable them <a href="#disabled-mods" id="disabled-mods"></a>

Go to your `Titanfall2` directory. From there go to the `R2Northstar` and delete `enabledmods.json`. This file stores information about which mods are enabled and disabled. By deleting this file Northstar will fall back to the default (all mods enabled) and re-create the file appropriately.

## MSVCR120.dll / MSVCP120.dll Not found <a href="#msvcr" id="msvcr"></a>

If you get this error you can fix it by [downloading and installing vcredist 2013 (`vcredist_x64.exe`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2013-vc-120).

![MSVCR120.dll Error](../images/msvcr.png)

## VCRUNTIME140 Not found <a href="#vcruntime" id="vcruntime"></a>

If you get this error you can fix it by [installing vcredist 2015-2022 (`vcredist_x64.exe`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022). If it does not work install the 2013 version

## Launch Northstar Locked <a href="#locked-northstar" id="locked-northstar"></a>

Go to Mods at the bottom of your screen on the main menu, then click Authentication Agreement and accept

## I can't open the console <a href="#console" id="console"></a>

* Navigate to your Titanfall2 directory then open
* Open `R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.Client\mod\cfg\autoexec_ns_client.cfg`
  * And change the \` to one of the F keys (for example `F1` / `F2`) (Note: _Only \~ or F1-12 work_) - This _should_ fix it
    * _Restart game!_

## The Main Menu is blank <a href="#blank-menu" id="blank-menu"></a>

* Please remove conflicting mods such as `better.serverbrowser` and reinstall _Northstar core mods_ (those that start with `Northstar.` / are in the [NorthstarMods repository](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarMods) / included in the release zip).\\
* Try deleting `enabledmods.json` inside the R2Northstar folder as well.
* Otherwise pay attention in console for your errors if you know what you're doing.

## Adding Launch Options <a href="#launch-opts" id="launch-opts"></a>

Adding `-northstar` will start Northstar when launching from your launcher\
Adding `-vanilla` will start the normal game when you have Northstar installed

* For Steam
  * `Your library > Right click TF|2 > Properties > Launch Options > -northstar or -vanilla`
* For Origin
  * `Your library > Right click TF|2 > Game Properties > Advanced Launch Options > Command Line Arguments > -northstar or -vanilla`

## Verifying Game Files <a href="#verify-files" id="verify-files"></a>

This is a small guide to help you understand how to verify the files of your game

* For Steam
  * `Your library > Right click TF|2 > Properties > Local Files > Verify integrity of game files...`
* For EA app
  * `My collection > Click the three dots on TF|2 > Repair`
* For Origin
  * `My Game Library > Click on TF|2 > Click the gear icon > Repair`

## Access Violation

If your error says `Access Violation | Attempted to read from 0x00000000` specifically DO NOT post just THAT.\
The real error is most likely slightly higher. Please post that in issues or the discord

## I can't play the Campaign <a href="#campaign" id="campaign"></a>

If you're having trouble playing the campaign, update your Northstar install to the [newest release](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) as this issue was resolved in `v1.11.2` of Northstar.

## Authentication Failed when clicking Launch Northstar <a href="#lsx2" id="lsx2"></a>

Before trying this check out [this section](troubleshooting.md#lsx).\
Alternative to that fix:

1. Close the game
2. Open task manager
3. End Origin (everything origin related)
4. Launch Origin as admin
5. Start the game through Origin with `-northstar` in [launch options](troubleshooting.md#launch-opts)
6. See if that fixed it

## Could't Initialize Sound / DEVICE\_IN\_USE <a href="#initsound" id="initsound"></a>

![Engine Error: Could't Initialize Sound](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2706225/153178714-2a50ac25-59fa-44d6-a47a-910058ec9888.png)

If message contains: `AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_IN_USE`

1. Go to Windows Search Bar, type `mmsys.cpl`, press enter.
2. Make sure you selected the right audio device as default (your headset or speakers usually).
3. If it still does not work, disable exclusive mode on your default device: ![Disable exclusive mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2706225/153179355-01598326-3297-4588-be4b-ed5257e23941.png)
4. Restart your computer.

This issue could also be caused if you use some sort of audio wrapper to control volume and stuff like Voicemeter Banana. The above fix was tested with Voicemeter Banana.

## Windows 11 AutoHDR disabled while using Northstar

You need to launch Northstar via Titanfall2 with `-northstar` passed as argument. To do this, go go to Steam/Origin (depending on where you bought the game), navigate to the settings where you can set launch arguments for Titanfall2. Add `-northstar` so that it launches Northstar instead. Launch the game via Steam/Origin.

Relevant issue on GitHub: [https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/issues/284](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/issues/284)

## I used a command to set my player/gun XP level and I set it too high so now my game crashes when trying to join multiplayer

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following command will reset all your loadouts and levels!
{% endhint %}

Open console in-game in main menu, type in `ns_resetpersistence` and press enter. Close console again and click on "Launch Northstar". All your stuff should now be reset.

## Cannot write log file when using Northstar on EA App

The default install location for EA App `C:\Program Files\EA Games\Titanfall2` is not writeable by non-admin processes. This messes with Northstar trying to write log files as well as mod-managers trying to install mods.

Therefore the recommended solution is to move the install to another location (can even be on the same drive). This prevents the non-admin issue and as such should solve the issue of Northstar being unable to write logs and failing.

The recommended solution can be done by moving the Titanfall 2 folder from the default location to something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Games\Titanfall2`. After doing this, you will need to open the EA App, go to Settings, go to Downloads and change the install directory in the settings. Click _"Edit"_ next to _"Install Location"_ and navigate to your new directory that you put Titanfall 2 into.

![EA App Settings](../images/ea-app.png)

Restart EA App after doing this, and the issue should be resolved. If not, hitting _Install_ on Titanfall 2 should prompt EA App to look for the files, or ask you to set the game's directory.
