## Pre-installed mods

Northstar by default comes with 3 mods installed. They are located in the `Titanfall2\R2Northstar\mods` folder. You can access these from the `Mods` menu at the bottom of the main menu.

- **Northstar.Client** - Various ui and client changes to fix bugs and add better support for mods
- **Northstar.Custom** - Additional gamemodes and weapons for the game, such as Fastball, Titan Tag, Infection, and Hide and Seek.
- **Northstar.CustomServers** - The basic mod for hosting servers with additional match settings

## Community created mods

Northstar additionally has many mods that are created by members of the community which are avaliable on the [Northstar Discord](https://northstar.tf/discord).
They can be found in the following channels:

- `#northstar-client-mods` for client-side only mods like HUD changes, skins, etc.
- `#northstar-server-mods` for mods that primarily target servers, like new gamemodes, moderation tools, etc.

### Thunderstore

Northstar also has a [Thunderstore](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/) page! You can find lots of mods here too! These mods are packaged slightly differently, and therefore have a different install proccess.
In each `.zip` you download from Thunderstore, there will, at minimum be 2 files, `icon.png` and `manifest.json`. You can ignore or delete those. There will also be a folder called `mods` and in said folder the mod itself. Move the contents of the mods folder into `R2Northstar\mods` and you should be good!
