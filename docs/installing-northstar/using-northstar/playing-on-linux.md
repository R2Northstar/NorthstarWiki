# Playing on Linux 🐧

Linux is not officially supported currently. However, you can get it working through Proton or Wine by following this guide.

> Please read this section on [common issues with Origin](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/Origin.md) before proceding.

## Installing

### Steam (Proton)

1. Download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page
2. Extract all contents of the file to your Titanfall 2 folder ( Right click _Titanfall 2_ > Open _Properties_ > Click _Local Files_ > Click _Browse_ )
3. Rename _Titanfall2.exe_ to anything else ( for example _Titanfall2old.exe_ ), and rename _NorthstarLauncher.exe_ to _Titanfall2.exe_. Alternatively to renaming _NorthstarLauncher.exe_, you can create a symlink to make future Northstar updates easier. This can be done by executing the following in the Titanfall 2 directory:

`ln NorthstarLauncher.exe Titanfall2.exe`

Now Steam will automatically launch Northstar when you hit play. Just launch the game through Steam and you should be greeted with a Northstar welcome message upon entering the main menu.

> **Note:** There is a current bug where the game would sometimes launch vanilla Titanfall 2 instead of Northstar. There is no universal fix for this, but people have reported changing Proton versions to _Proton 5.13_ or _Proton Experimental_ and deleting the Proton prefix folder (`Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1237970/`) could help resolve this issue. Using [Proton GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) has also been reported to resolve the issue.
>
> If you are still suffering from this bug, try running the game through Lutris. The bug doesn't seem to happen there

### Lutris (Wine)

1. If you don't already have the game downloaded, install the game [from here.](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2/)
2. Download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page
3. Extract all contents of the file to your Titanfall 2 folder

4. **If you have the game installed on Lutris:** right click _Titanfall 2_ > _Configure_ > _Game Options_ > Set _Executable path_ to _NorthstarLauncher.exe_
5. **Otherwise:** click the `+` button in the top left > set the name to whatever and _Runner_ to _Wine_ > click on _Game options_ > set _Executable path_ to _NorthstarLauncher.exe_ then save.

> **If you're migrating from Steam:** Set _Wine prefix_ to `(your Steam directory)/steamapps/compatdata/1237970/pfx/`. This will save you the hassle of having to re-download Origin.

Now just launch the game through Lutris and you should be greeted with a Northstar welcome message upon entering the main menu.

> **Note:** Origin might prompt you to log in and "set an installation folder for future downloads" on first launch. Just do those, close Origin, then launch the game again.

## LatencyFleX

LatencyFleX is a Linux-only input latency reduction alternative to Nvidia Reflex that is supported by Northstar. Currently, LatencyFleX requires manual installation. A full install guide and current releases [can be found on their GitHub](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX).

Northstar only requires the [Vulkan layer](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX#latencyflex-vulkan-layer-essential) and [Wine extensions](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX#latencyflex-wine-extensions-required-for-proton-reflex-integration) steps to be completed.

Once installed, LatencyFleX can be enabled by doing either of the following:

- **Steam:** Add the following to your Titanfall 2 launch options: `"LFX=1 %command%"`
- **Lutris:** Right click on Titanfall 2, click 'Configure', navigate to 'System Preferences' / 'System Options' / 'Environmental Variables', and use the following:

> Key: LFX
Value: 1

Once in-game, LatencyFleX can be toggled off and on using the `"r_latencyflex"` console variable.

While playing with LatencyFleX, **VSync and Adaptive Super Sampling must be disabled**. If you wish to prevent tearing while using LatencyFleX, the following may be added to the end of `ns_startup_args.txt` in the root of your Titanfall 2 install:

> +fps_max_use_refresh 1

## Troubleshooting

### Blank console

This problem is caused due to missing fonts on your Titanfall 2 wine prefix, you will need [winetricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks) or [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) depending on your installation. Follow these steps to install:

1. Close all Titanfall/Origin processes.
2. If you are using Lutris select your Titanfall 2 installation and click '▲' -> Winetricks. On Proton you can use `protontricks 1237970 --gui`
3. 'Select the default wineprefix' -> 'Install a font' -> Check the packages `lucida` and `arial`.
4. Click OK and wait for everything to install, if done correctly winetricks will popup again.
5. You can now close it and launch the game.

### Crackling sound
Can be fixed by adding `tsched=0` to `/etc/pulse/default.pa`

### Fullscreen issues

Running the game on fullscreen through Linux might lead to a black screen preventing you from launching the game. Edit your `ns_startup_args.txt` to include `-noborder -window` or edit `"setting.fullscreen"` and `"setting.nowindowborder"` at `<wineprefix>/drive_c/users/<username>/Documents/Respawn/Titanfall2/local/videoconfig.txt` to solve this.

For more info and proposed fixes, refer to [this issue thread on Github](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/issues/1)

### LatencyFleX issues

Some users have reported issues with enabling LatencyFleX. If you see `"Unable to load LatencyFleX library, LatencyFleX disabled."` in your logs, try adding `latencyflex_wine.dll` to your `bin/x64_retail` folder.

### Game crashes on launch with Cause: Access Violation Data Execution Prevention (DEP) at: 0x00000000

try running with [ProtonGE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/).

### Reducing stuttering (Wine and Proton)

_Pre-compiled DXVK cache_: https://github.com/begin-theadventure/dxvk-caches/raw/main/Titanfall%202/Titanfall2.dxvk-cache.tar.xz

Proton: extract and put in path/steamapps/shadercache/1237970/DXVK_state_cache

Wine: extract and put it next to game's .exe. Also remember to rename it if the .exe has a different name)

_DXVK-async_:

Wine: https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/releases (put it in ~/.local/share/lutris/runtime/dxvk extract and type name in "DXVK version" of the folder, to enable set the environment variable `DXVK_ASYNC 1`)

Proton: can be used with **Proton-GE**. Type `DXVK_ASYNC 1` under `LAUNCH OPTIONS`.

_Prevent Origin from writing certain files_: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/4001#issuecomment-647014231

Path:

Proton: `x/steamapps/compatdata/1237970/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Application Data/Origin`

Wine: `x/drive_c/users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Origin`

Access can be restricted using a file manager or terminal:

`chmod -R 555` ->access only

`chmod -R 755`  ->access + save

It's also possible to make command aliases to type something short like tfoff/tfon.
