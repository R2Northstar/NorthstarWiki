# Northstar installers

Since the public release of Northstar, the wider community has created tools to automate mod installation, as well as adding additional features such as auto-updating the current Northstar install and mod management.

Note that none of these tools directly part of the Northstar project and as such any issues with them should be reported to the respective authors instead.
