# Progression

As of version `1.19.0` Northstar allows you to toggle the progression system.
This means that you can choose whether to have everything unlocked or not.
By default progression is disabled and all weapons and skins are unlocked.

## Enabling/Disabling Progression

1. Go into the multiplayer lobby
2. Click on the "Toggle Progression" button at the bottom of the screen
