# Installing on SteamDeck and Linux

## Steam & Steam Deck (NorthstarProton)

{% hint style="warning" %}
EA App currently displays a blank screen when using NorthstarProton, however Northstar will still launch assuming you have logged in to EA App at least once.
{% endhint %}

> **Check your GLIBC version.** NorthstarProton currently only supports version 2.33 and higher. Verify your installed version with `ldd --version`. **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** and **Debian 11** are known to have outdated GLIBC packages, meaning you will have to experiment with finding a Proton version that works for you, or use Lutris. It is therefore strongly recommended to use an up-to-date Linux distro to be able to make use of NorthstarProton. This check does not need to be completed on Steam Deck or Steam OS.

On Steam Deck, complete the following in desktop mode. You may return to game mode once completed _(A mouse + keyboard plugged into the Deck are recommended for easier navigation of menus)_

1. Make sure you ran the vanilla version of Titanfall2 at least once on Linux!
2. Install the latest version of Northstar using [FlightCore](../installing-northstar/northstar-installers#geckoeidechse-flightcore), [Viper](../installing-northstar/northstar-installers#0negal-viper), or do it manually
   1. For manual install download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page
   2. Then extract all contents of the file to your Titanfall 2 folder ( Right click _Titanfall 2_ > Open _Properties_ > Click _Local Files_ > Click _Browse_ )
3. Install NorthstarProton
   1. **Protonup-QT**: Click _About_, then tick the box to enable _advanced mode_. You should be able to select and install NorthstarProton from the _Add version_ menu.
   2. **ProtonPlus**: NorthstarProton can also be installed via ProtonPlus.
   3. **Manual**: Download the latest release of [NorthstarProton](https://github.com/cyrv6737/NorthstarProton/releases/), extract it, and place the folder in one of the following directories:
      * **Steam (Native Package) & Steam Deck:** `~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d`
      * **Steam (Flatpak):** `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/`
4. Restart Steam. Head to `Properties -> Compatibility` under Titanfall2. Check `Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool` checkbox, then set the Steam Play compatibility tool to NorthstarProton.
5. Add `%command% -northstar` as a [launch option](../installing-northstar/troubleshooting.md#launch-opts) to Titanfall2
6. Launch Titanfall2, it should now launch Northstar

Note that removing the `%command% -northstar` will cause Steam to launch the vanilla game again.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide assumes you're *up to date with NorthstarProton*, as the method used to launch Northstar changed in NorthstarProton-8.1-1 which was released on 2023-02-22.\
If you're using an older version of NorthstarProton, replace the information about launch options with a text file called `run_northstar.txt` in your Titanfall2 directory. This text file should have a single character `1` inside.
{% endhint %}

## Lutris (Wine)

1. Install the EA App first [from here.](https://lutris.net/games/ea-app/)
2. Download and install Titanfall 2 from the EA App, run the vanilla version at least once.
3. Download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page.
4. Extract all contents of the file to your Titanfall 2 folder.
4. **If you have the game installed on Lutris:** right click _EA App_ > _Duplicate_ > _Yes_. Then right click the new _EA App 2_ > _Configure_ > _Game Options_ > Set _Executable path_ to _NorthstarLauncher.exe_ and add `-northstar` to the _Arguments_. Optionally, change the name of the EA App 2 shortcut to Northstar and change the identifier to `titanfall-2`
5. **Otherwise:** click the `+` button in the top left > set the name to whatever and _Runner_ to _Wine_ > click on _Game options_ > set _Executable path_ to _NorthstarLauncher.exe_ and add `-northstar` to the _Arguments_ then save.

In order for the game to launch, you need to launch the EA App first, then launch the Northstar.exe shortcut with the `-northstar` argument.
You should be greeted with a Northstar welcome message upon entering the main menu.

> **Note:** The EA App might prompt you to log in and "set an installation folder for future downloads" on first launch. Just do those, close the EA App, and then launch the game again.

**Steam Deck Users:** Add both the EA App and Northstar Lutris shortcuts to Steam. Right click them in Lutris then hit _Create steam shortcut_.
Now in Gaming Mode, if you launch the EA App first, then hit the Home button and launch Northstar while the EA App is still running, the game will launch succesfully.

## LatencyFleX

LatencyFleX is a Linux-only input latency reduction alternative to Nvidia Reflex that is supported by Northstar.

LatencyFleX's Vulkan layer can be installed with your package manager on supported distributions. On Arch it's available in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/latencyflex-git), and on Fedora/openSUSE Tumbleweed it can be acquired from [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kylegospo/LatencyFleX/).

If you're using another distro you will need to install LatencyFleX manually. A full install guide and current releases [can be found on their GitHub](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX). Northstar only requires the [Vulkan layer](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX#latencyflex-vulkan-layer-essential) and [Wine extensions](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX#latencyflex-wine-extensions-required-for-proton-reflex-integration) steps to be completed. **If you are using NorthstarProton, the Wine extensions are automatically installed and only the Vulkan layer is required.**

Once installed, LatencyFleX can be enabled by doing either of the following:

* **Steam:** Add the following to your Titanfall 2 launch options: `"LFX=1 %command%"`
* **Lutris:** Right click on Titanfall 2, click 'Configure', navigate to 'System Preferences' / 'System Options' / 'Environmental Variables', and use the following:

> Key: LFX Value: 1

Once in-game, LatencyFleX can be toggled off and on using the `"r_latencyflex"` console variable.

While playing with LatencyFleX, **VSync and Adaptive Super Sampling must be disabled**. If you wish to prevent tearing while using LatencyFleX, the following may be added to the end of `ns_startup_args.txt` in the root of your Titanfall 2 install:

> \+fps\_max\_use\_refresh 1
