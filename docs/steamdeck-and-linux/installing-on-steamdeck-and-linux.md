# Installing on SteamDeck and Linux

## Steam & Steam Deck (NorthstarProton)

{% hint style="warning" %}
EA App currently displays a blank screen when using NorthstarProton, however Northstar will still launch assuming you have logged in to EA App at least once.
{% endhint %}

> **Northstar does not work on Ubuntu and Debian distros.** This issue is being [worked on](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/issues/469), but until its fixed the workaround to this is using Distrobox, which will be explained further down, or using a known supported distro like Fedora or Arch. You will still need to follow the instructions below to install Northstar with the Steam (Native Package) path.

If you are using a Steam Deck, complete the following in desktop mode. You may return to game mode once completed _(A mouse + keyboard plugged into the Deck are recommended for easier navigation of menus)_

1. Make sure you ran the vanilla version of Titanfall2 at least once on Linux!
2. Install the latest version of Northstar using [FlightCore](../installing-northstar/northstar-installers#geckoeidechse-flightcore), [Viper](../installing-northstar/northstar-installers#0negal-viper), or do it manually
   1. For manual install download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page
   2. Then extract all contents of the file to your Titanfall 2 folder ( Right click _Titanfall 2_ > Open _Properties_ > Click _Local Files_ > Click _Browse_ )
3. Install NorthstarProton
   1. **Protonup-QT**: Click _About_, then tick the box to enable _advanced mode_. You should be able to select and install NorthstarProton from the _Add version_ menu.
   2. **ProtonPlus**: NorthstarProton can also be installed via ProtonPlus.
   3. **Manual**: Download the latest release of [NorthstarProton](https://github.com/cyrv6737/NorthstarProton/releases/), extract it, and place the folder in one of the following directories:
      * **Steam (Native Package) & Steam Deck:** `~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d`
      * **Steam (Flatpak):** `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/`
4. Restart Steam. Head to `Properties -> Compatibility` under Titanfall2. Check `Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool` checkbox, then set the Steam Play compatibility tool to NorthstarProton.
5. Add `%command% -northstar` as a [launch option](../installing-northstar/troubleshooting.md#launch-opts) to Titanfall2
6. Launch Titanfall2, it should now launch Northstar

Note that removing the `%command% -northstar` will cause Steam to launch the vanilla game again.

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide assumes you're *up to date with NorthstarProton*, as the method used to launch Northstar changed in NorthstarProton-8.1-1 which was released on 2023-02-22.\
If you're using an older version of NorthstarProton, replace the information about launch options with a text file called `run_northstar.txt` in your Titanfall2 directory. This text file should have a single character `1` inside.
{% endhint %}

### Ubuntu / Debian
This workaround employs the use of [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) to create a Fedora instance and install Steam to it. Your Fedora instance created through this method will share the same Steam files that the native package uses, so you won't have to re-download Titanfall 2.

1. Open a terminal and install Distrobox with `sudo apt install distrobox`
2. Run `distrobox-create --image fedora:latest --name Fedora`
3. Enter your newly created instance with `distrobox-enter Fedora`
4. Enable `rpm-fusion` by running `sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm`
5. Install Steam by running `sudo dnf install steam`
6. Export Steam out of your instance by running `distrobox-export steam`, this creates a `.desktop` file outside of the instance that allows Steam to be ran in the container from a shortcut, allowing you to run it without needing to enter your Fedora instance every time.
7. Search for `Steam (Runtime) (on Fedora)` in your Applications, and optionally pin it to your taskbar.
8. If you haven't already, follow the steps above to install NorthstarProton.

**Updating distrobox container: (optional)**

We recommend keeping your Fedora instance up to date, which can be done manually by running `sudo dnf update` inside of your Fedora instance.
Optionally, you can also automate this process by creating this automatic update script utilizing `systemd`.
On your host, use your preferred text editor to create `~/.config/systemd/user/distrobox-upgrade-automatic.timer` with the following content:
```
[Unit]
Description=distrobox-upgrade Automatic Update Trigger

[Timer]
OnBootSec=1h
OnUnitInactiveSec=1d

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Then, create `~/.config/systemd/user/distrobox-upgrade-automatic.service` with the following content:
```
[Unit]
Description=distrobox-upgrade Automatic Update
 
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/distrobox-upgrade --all
StandardOutput=null
```

Finally, run the following in a terminal:
```
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable distrobox-upgrade-automatic.timer
```

## Lutris (Wine)

1. If you don't already have the game downloaded, install the game [from here.](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2/)
2. Download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page
3. Extract all contents of the file to your Titanfall 2 folder
4. **If you have the game installed on Lutris:** right click _Titanfall 2_ > _Configure_ > _Game Options_ > Set _Executable path_ to _NorthstarLauncher.exe_
5. **Otherwise:** click the `+` button in the top left > set the name to whatever and _Runner_ to _Wine_ > click on _Game options_ > set _Executable path_ to _NorthstarLauncher.exe_ then save.

Now just launch the game through Lutris and you should be greeted with a Northstar welcome message upon entering the main menu.

> **Note:** Origin might prompt you to log in and "set an installation folder for future downloads" on first launch. Just do those, close Origin, then launch the game again.

## LatencyFleX

LatencyFleX is a Linux-only input latency reduction alternative to Nvidia Reflex that is supported by Northstar.

LatencyFleX's Vulkan layer can be installed with your package manager on supported distributions. On Arch it's available in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/latencyflex-git), and on Fedora/openSUSE Tumbleweed it can be acquired from [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kylegospo/LatencyFleX/).

If you're using another distro you will need to install LatencyFleX manually. A full install guide and current releases [can be found on their GitHub](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX). Northstar only requires the [Vulkan layer](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX#latencyflex-vulkan-layer-essential) and [Wine extensions](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX#latencyflex-wine-extensions-required-for-proton-reflex-integration) steps to be completed. **If you are using NorthstarProton, the Wine extensions are automatically installed and only the Vulkan layer is required.**

Once installed, LatencyFleX can be enabled by doing either of the following:

* **Steam:** Add the following to your Titanfall 2 launch options: `"LFX=1 %command%"`
* **Lutris:** Right click on Titanfall 2, click 'Configure', navigate to 'System Preferences' / 'System Options' / 'Environmental Variables', and use the following:

> Key: LFX Value: 1

Once in-game, LatencyFleX can be toggled off and on using the `"r_latencyflex"` console variable.

While playing with LatencyFleX, **VSync and Adaptive Super Sampling must be disabled**. If you wish to prevent tearing while using LatencyFleX, the following may be added to the end of `ns_startup_args.txt` in the root of your Titanfall 2 install:

> \+fps\_max\_use\_refresh 1
