# Helping

This section is meant mostly for those that will be actively helping others in the Northstar Discord server or otherwise.
If you've somehow stumbled upon this page trying to fix an issue for yourself, you should try checking the [troubleshooting page](installing-northstar/troubleshooting.md) instead. 
If you're a helper, it also isn't a bad idea to look at this page a few times and try to have a rough idea of the things that are on it.
